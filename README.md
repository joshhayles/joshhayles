## My Approach: I See the Big Picture AND the Details

I'm naturally curious about the **"why"** behind how things work. Instead of just learning twenty different technologies on the surface, I'd rather deeply understand the foundational principles of one or two - like really mastering Kubernetes networking rather than knowing a little bit about everything.

**What drives me**: Taking fragmented, overwhelming technical information and organizing it into clear, connected systems that actually help people get things done - whether that's for myself, my teammates, or entire organizations.

I spot patterns in chaos. I build useful connections from scattered pieces. I create systems that don't just work for me, but help others solve similar problems.

## Current Role: Solutions Engineer II @ Datadog

**Specializing in Containers and Cloud environments**

**Focus:** Help customers integrate Datadog Agent into complex environments‚ÄîKubernetes, EC2, Fargate, AWS, VMs

**Daily Work:** Troubleshoot container deployments, configure log/metric/trace collection, solve customer-specific integration challenges

**Technical Expertise:** Kubernetes networking, AWS container services (ECS, Fargate), Docker orchestration, distributed system observability

**KaI Integration:** Applying Knowledge as Infrastructure principles to customer troubleshooting‚Äîsystematically capturing solution patterns, building reusable debugging frameworks, tracking resolution effectiveness

**Approach:** I naturally gravitate toward understanding the why behind integration issues rather than just applying quick fixes‚Äîthis debugging approach helps customers build more reliable monitoring setups and often reveals broader infrastructure improvements.

## üöÄ My Big Project: Knowledge as Infrastructure (KaI)

**Here's the problem:** We build production systems with incredible engineering rigor - monitoring, automation, version control, systematic operations. But our most valuable asset - our collective knowledge - exists as scattered notes, forgotten bookmarks, and tribal wisdom that disappears when people leave.

**What I'm building:** _Knowledge as Infrastructure (KaI, pronounced "k-eye")_ - applying the same engineering discipline to knowledge that we do to our production systems. Instead of information chaos, we get queryable knowledge. Instead of solving the same problems repeatedly, we build on what came before.

**The vision:** What if your knowledge worked like your code? Versioned, connected, and designed to compound over time.

### The Universal Knowledge Problem

We wouldn't run production systems without monitoring, version control, or systematic operations. Yet our collective knowledge lacks the same engineering rigor:

- **Documentation Graveyards**: Static information dumps instead of connected, queryable infrastructure
- **Knowledge Silos**: Solutions trapped in individual minds and scattered tools
- **No Observability**: We can't see knowledge gaps or track how expertise flows
- **Uncaptured Assets**: Thousands of hours solving problems, but solutions don't persist for the next person

**The AI Opportunity**: AI tools are only as powerful as the structured context you give them. Organized knowledge becomes high-octane fuel for AI collaboration.

### What I'm Building

**Current Focus (2025‚Äîand beyond)**: Proving KaI methodology works by applying it to my own Go programming learning journey. I'm documenting everything - the process, the results, the measurable improvements in learning velocity and knowledge retention.

**Early Results**: Using KaI approaches to systematically connect Docker networking knowledge to Kubernetes concepts, reducing typical learning curve from months to weeks.

**Technical Vision**: KaI CLI that treats knowledge like infrastructure - queryable, connected, persistent. Think "git for your expertise" combined with "infrastructure as code for learning."

**Real Impact Already Happening**:
- **For Developers**: Your Docker solution from 6 months ago automatically connects to today's Kubernetes challenge
- **For Teams**: Debugging sequences and solutions persist beyond individual tenure
- **For Organizations**: Customer insights flow systematically between engineering, sales, and support

### Current Technical Progress

**KaI Methodology**: Three-component pipeline (PRO System ‚Üí DEEP Learning ‚Üí KaI Infrastructure) being validated through real Go programming projects

**Platform Development**: Building knowledgeasinfrastructure.com as both methodology hub and live demonstration of KaI principles

**Business Validation**: Applying KaI approaches to Datadog troubleshooting workflows, tracking improvements in resolution time and knowledge transfer

**Long-term Goal**: Establish KaI-Ops as recognized engineering discipline - the "DevOps for knowledge work."

## What I've Built: Tax Corrector

**[Tax Corrector](https://www.taxcorrector.com) - Helping Homeowners Reduce their Property Taxes**

*How infrastructure thinking helped build the website that homeowners love*

**The Challenge**: The property tax assessment process is fragmented, complex, and overwhelming for homeowners 

**The Solution**: The Tax Corrector website consistently delivers **12-20% tax reductions** with 90% success rate for homeowners

**Infrastructure Approach**:
- **Data-driven algorithms** based on 15 years of real estate pattern recognition
- **Resilient architecture** (Django + AWS Fargate + SQS + Lambda) that separates concerns, and delivers custom PDF reports in real-time for users
- **Hundreds of paying customers** using the site each year flawlessly

**Technical Architecture**: Event-driven system using Stripe ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí Postgres. Demonstrates infrastructure thinking applied to business automation: separation of concerns, failure handling, and scalable processing pipelines.

## Where This All Started: Real Estate Systems

**15 Years Running My Own Real Estate Business**

Running a real estate business taught me to see **systems everywhere**. While other agents focused on individual transactions, I built processes that made everything more predictable and efficient:

- **Customer Experience**: Created step-by-step approaches for complex and fragmented home sales experiences that kept a client-centric mindset
- **"Inside the Mind of the Buyer"**: Developed a methodology (and newsletter) that helped sellers understand exactly what buyers were thinking‚Äîconsistently improved outcomes
- **Accurate Cost Estimates**: Built tools that predicted seller costs within $500‚Äî far better than industry standard tools
- **Scaling Under Pressure**: Turned high-volume client work into opportunities to improve systems and future marketing

*This is where I learned that good systems don't just work‚Äîthey make everything else easier.*

## Technical Foundation

### Full-Stack Development from Flatiron
**Flatiron School** (4 months, 50-60 hours/week): JavaScript, React, Ruby/Rails  

**Continuous Learning**: Advanced JavaScript, Node.js, CSS architecture, data structures & algorithms

*Technical skills serve systematic thinking - not the other way around.*

## What I Bring to Teams

### I See How Things Connect
- I naturally see both the individual pieces AND how they fit together
- I'm good at taking messy, complex problems and turning them into clear, manageable solutions  
- I create frameworks that help whole teams tackle similar challenges

### I Build Things That Last
- I focus on understanding the fundamentals rather than just quick fixes
- I build solutions that actually scale and get better over time, not ones that break under pressure
- I balance getting things done quickly with thinking ahead - "ready to ship and impress" but also built to last

### I Learn Systematically and Share It
- I learn by combining theory, hands-on building, and real-world application (not just tutorials or theory by itself)
- I create reusable patterns and approaches that speed up team learning
- I turn individual insights into things the whole team can use

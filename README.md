## My Quick Intro

I have 16 years of experience building and running my own Real Estate business. I have significant skills regarding customer service, the user experience (both, online via product use, as well as in-person communication with people), and I love building systems and processes that create efficiency, and helps others. Combining my business / customer skillset with my "stay curious" approach to technology gives me an advantage of being able to jump into a tech role and quickly understand what's best for the customer. I'm currently building my passion project that helps homeowners reduce their property taxes, while working full time as a Solutions Engineer with Datadog.


## My Background
- 16 years of experience in Real Estate

  - Created a six-figure business that I ran by myself 
  
  - I learned Entrepreneurship skills that taught me all aspects of business:
       - Customer Service
       - Customer-Centric Approach
       - Community Involvement (Home ownership affordability, helping homeowners lower property taxes)
       - Customer Interaction with hands-on communication methods, and automating systems for efficiency and accuracy 
       - Developing Business Plans Customized to my Client‚Äôs needs
       - Strong Written and Verbal Communication Skills (Real estate newsletters, Blogs, Neighborhood Analysis, etc)
       - Product and Technology Research that benefited my clients and business needs
       - Teamwork collaboration with a variety of parties involved in each transaction that required custom communication methods
       - Educating clients and the public about the market, technology, and trends
       - Creating memorable and pleasant experiences for my clients in a variety of ways


## My Software Engineer Background with Flatiron
- At Flatiron, I learned a variety of technology and put in 50 to 60 hours of work per week into their program for roughly 4 months

- The overall technology was focused on full stack development. I learned Javascript (in its raw form first), then React for the framework. For the backend we learned Ruby / Rails.
- Since then, I have focused on improving my Web Development skills using: JavaScript (Pure / Vanilla), advanced JavaScript, CSS / Styling and Prototyping, Svelte/Sveltekit, Node.js, and solving DSAs (Data Structures and Algorithms).

## Why I love Software Engineering
- I‚Äôm a tech-enthusiast, especially when it comes to Real Estate technology

    - I thrive on a fast-paced environment that allows me to learn new things
    
    - I love creativity and having the ability to constantly make improvements
    
    - I want to combine my business skills with technology and solve problems for homeowners
    
    
## What I Bring to the Table
- Team Player  üëä 
    - I love working with people who are eager to learn and love to talk about technology
    
    - Whatever needs to be done to help the team, I‚Äôm all-in.


    - Innovative ideas for improving / creating products and services to benefit the team‚Äôs goals.

    - Collaborating with the team and communicating effectively is important to me.
    
    - Loyalty. When I commit, I commit.


- Passionate, Hard Work (with a never-ending appetite for learning and improvement)  ‚õëÔ∏è 
    - Working hard is something that came natural to me in Real Estate because I loved everything about it. That same passion is applied to tech and entrepreneurial services that improve the user‚Äôs experience 
    
    - I‚Äôm currently studying Cloud Technologies, Containers (Kubernetes and Docker),and advanced troubleshooting on a daily basis at Datadog
    
    - I‚Äôm not only capable of learning any technology that‚Äôs needed for the job, I‚Äôm excited to do so!


- Understanding Product Features | User Benefits | User Experience (really well)  ü§ó 
    - I‚Äôm great at researching a product, getting feedback from customers, documenting that feedback, putting together a report to analyze that information, and making suggestions on what‚Äôs best for the product and customer‚Äôs experience
    
    - I‚Äôm also great at coming up with creative and innovative ideas for new products / services (especially Real Estate, Investing, Homeownership, and Finance)
    
        - Example: I created a publication called ‚ÄúInside the Mind of the Buyer‚Äù that taught Homeowners how to think like a buyer before they put their home on the market. When you list your home and you‚Äôre asking someone to pay a price for it you‚Äôre now in the presentation game. Your home is open to public opinion, and you have to care about every detail because that‚Äôs what the buyer is thinking as they walk through your home:
        
            - I had to understand everything about my client‚Äôs goals and create a custom plan that fit their needs, desires, timelines, communication preferences, their expectations, etc.
            
            - I anticipated areas of concern, objections they would likely have and I created custom plans to make sure there weren‚Äôt any holes that needed to be plugged in my process:
            
                - Example: I created an estimated proceeds sheet called provides a breakdown of all the costs associated to the seller when they sell their home, and an estimated ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù amount to give them an idea of how much money they‚Äôll get at the closing table. I was within $500.00 accuracy with this approach (it was reliable and predictable)
                
                - I presented this at our initial meeting because I knew it would help them make an informed decision about selling.
                
## üëæ   Products / Services I Created

### 1. Tax Corrector [in-process]  üí∞ 
    
    1. This is a website that gives homeowners in Texas the ability to print off a Protest Report that will give them the best chance at having their property taxes reduced
    2. I have personally done these reports for hundreds of homeowners the last two years for $25.00 each. There are literally millions of homeowners in Texas that need help every year with this
    3. The next steps for the site is to use my local MLS‚Äôs API and RETS Data feed to give homeowners access to the information they need, then to incorporate the PDF Download feature so they can download their report. It will be ready, and released to the public by early March next year (which is the next tax season)
    4. Future income streams will be added to this project like:
        1. Tax Corrector Paid membership
        2. Local Realtors can sponsor the reports that are downloaded for a fee
        3. Homeowners can access our preferred Realtor Network when they‚Äôre ready to sell, and Tax Corrector will get paid a 25% referral fee from the Realtor

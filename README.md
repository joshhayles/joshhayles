## My Quick Intro

I have 16 years of experience building and running my own six-figure Real Estate business. I have significant skills regarding customer service, customer/user experience (both; online via product use, as well as in-person communication with people), and I love building systems and processes that solve problems and help people. I'm now combining my business and customer skillset with my technology skills in Javascript and Front-End experiences. I'm currently building my passion project that will help homeowners reduce their property taxes, while working full time as a Solutions Engineer with Datadog.

## My Software Engineer Background with Flatiron

## Why I love being a Software Engineer
- I‚Äôm a tech-enthusiast, especially when it comes to Real Estate technology

    - I thrive on a fast-paced environment that allows me to learn new things
    
    - I love creativity and having the ability to constantly make improvements
    
    - I want to combine my business skills with technology and solve problems 
    
    
## What I Bring to the Table
- Team Player  üëä 
    - You‚Äôll never hear ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my job‚Äù from me
    
    - Whatever needs to be done to help the team, I‚Äôm all-in. If someone needs me to cover for them, no problem at all. Someone needs me to pick up the slack and help with additional work, no sweat. Whatever it takes


    - Innovative ideas for improving / creating products and services to benefit the team‚Äôs goals


    - Collaborating with the team and communicating effectively is important to me
    
    - Loyalty. When I commit, I‚Äôm all-in


- Passionate, Hard Work (with a never-ending appetite for learning and improvement)  ‚õëÔ∏è 
    - Working hard is something that came natural to me in Real Estate because I loved everything about it. That same passion is now being applied to tech and entrepreneurial services that improve the user‚Äôs experience 
    
    - I‚Äôm currently studying DSA‚Äôs, Javascript, and testing software using tools like Cypress and Jest on a daily basis
    
    - I‚Äôm not only capable of learning any technology that‚Äôs needed for the job, I‚Äôm excited to do so!


- Understanding Product Features | User Benefits | User Experience (really well)  ü§ó 
    - I‚Äôm great at researching a product, getting feedback from customers, documenting that feedback, putting together a report to analyze that information, and making suggestions on what‚Äôs best for the product and customer‚Äôs experience
    
    - I‚Äôm also great at coming up with creative and innovative ideas for new products / services (especially Real Estate, Investing, Homeownership, and Finance)
    
    - Putting myself in the customer‚Äôs shoes and having an experience through their eyes is something I‚Äôve done well for more than 16 years in Real Estate:
    
        - Example: I created a publication called ‚ÄúInside the Mind of the Buyer‚Äù that taught Homeowners how to think like a buyer before they put their home on the market. When you list your home and you‚Äôre asking someone to pay a price for it you‚Äôre now in the presentation game. Your home is open to public opinion, and you have to care about every detail because that‚Äôs what the buyer is thinking as they walk through your home:
        
            - I had to understand everything about my client‚Äôs goals and create a custom plan that fit their needs, desires, timelines, communication preferences, their expectations, etc.
            
            - I anticipated (I didn‚Äôt wait for them to ask) areas of concern, objections they would likely have, and I created custom plans to make sure there weren‚Äôt any holes that needed to be plugged in my process:
            
                - Example: I created an estimated proceeds sheet called provides a breakdown of all the costs associated to the seller when they sell their home, and an estimated ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù amount to give them an idea of how much money they‚Äôll get at the closing table. I was within $500.00 accuracy with this approach (it was reliable and predictable)
                
                - I presented this at our initial meeting because I knew it would help them make an informed decision about selling. I didn‚Äôt wait until the last minute
                
## üëæ   Products / Services I Created

### 1. Tax Corrector [in-process]  üí∞ 
    
    1. This is a website that gives homeowners in Texas the ability to print off a Protest Report that will give them the best chance at having their property taxes reduced
    2. I have personally done these reports for hundreds of homeowners the last two years for $25.00 each. There are literally millions of homeowners in Texas that need help every year with this
    3. The next steps for the site is to use my local MLS‚Äôs API and RETS Data feed to give homeowners access to the information they need, then to incorporate the PDF Download feature so they can download their report. It will be ready, and released to the public by early March next year (which is the next tax season)
    4. Future income streams will be added to this project like:
        1. Tax Corrector Paid membership
        2. Local Realtors can sponsor the reports that are downloaded for a fee
        3. Homeowners can access our preferred Realtor Network when they‚Äôre ready to sell, and Tax Corrector will get paid a 25% referral fee from the Realtor
    5. Please review my Github for this project and take a look at the code that‚Äôs currently implemented. I used Rails to incorporate a full Auth login process with B-Crypt, Javascript, React, and Material UI for the front-end. I became really comfortable with Ruby and Rails on this project

### 2. Code Red
    
    1. A fun and unique approach to having weekly tech conversations with people from all walks of tech life. Click the ‚Äúcode red‚Äô link to see more
